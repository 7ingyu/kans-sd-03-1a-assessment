Graded Activity: Pet Tribute Page
=================================

You have decided to enter a competition in which you create a tribute page to your pet online for first-time developers. In order for your entry to be accepted, you need to title the page with your petâ€™s name and provide their adoption date, a link to an image, a two-sentence bio about your pet, and an ordered list of three facts about your pet.

Once you complete these criteria, you can enter the competition. Good luck! We know you can do it!

Note: If you do not have a pet, pretend you do for the purposes of this assessment.

Prompt & Starter Code
---------------------

You will need to write code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, starter code has already been provided for you, so please DO NOT ADAPT the existing code. Only write code under the comments where you are instructed to.

### Starter Code

*   Click [HERE](https://replit.com/@SD-Team/newAssessent-SD#index.html) for the link to the replit.

*   Fork (not clone) it to your OWN replit account. Note that the 'fork' button should be in the upper-right corner of the page.

*   You will see three files in the replit: index.html, style.css, and script.js. You will write missing code as instructed.

As always, look at the code you already have before writing new code.

### Starting Point

You will get some starter code with HTML, CSS, and JS provided. If you hit Run at the top of the replit, t he website that displays to the right should look like this:

*   Your instructor will read through this prompt and demo an example of the final product. This is the perfect time to ask any clarifying questions.

*   You will have up to THREE hours to complete this skills assessment. This is an open-book skills assessment. Any class curriculum and personal notes are fair game.

*   Because you need your own unique instance of the assessment code, be sure to fork the starter code replit and read through the existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

*   Your job is to complete the index.html, style.css, and script.js files (located in the left "Files" column) so that your app meets all the success criteria listed below.

*   When you think you are finished, check in with your instructor, who will let you know if you have passed the assessment. As long as there is time remaining, you can keep trying to fix any issues.

*   Once your instructor has recorded your results, attempt the bonus criteria. Be sure to check in with your instructor again when you think you have completed it.

### Important Reminders

*   You have 3 hours to complete this assessment.

*   As long as there is time remaining, you can keep trying to fix any issues.

*   This is an open-book test. Any class materials or anything on websites like StackOverflow are fair game.

*   You may ask your instructor clarifying questions at any time.

*   Not all goals listed below are needed in order to secure a passing grade. Regardless of how close or far away you are to finishing the goals below, please show your instructor your progress.

### Your Goals

Use the below directions and grading rubric as a guide for completing each portion of the assessment. Note that not all of these goals need to be accomplished to obtain a minimum passing grade. See the grading criteria in the table below.

*   In the index.html file:
    
    Create an h1 tag with your pet's name.
    
    Create an h2 tag with your pet's adoption date.
    
    Update the img tag to be an image of a pet from Google (such as a cat https://placekitten.com/200/300 or a dog https://placedog.net/500/280).
    
    Add a p tag with two sentences about your pet.
    
    Add an ol tag with three li tags inside. These should be fun facts about your pet.
    

*   In the style.css file:
    
    Add code to make your image a 300px square.
    
    Add code to change the color and font family of your name/title; this is your choice.
    
    Change the color of your list elements. Again, this is your choice.
    

*   In the script.js file:
    
    Obtain the img element by using the document.getElementById method, and assign it to the image variable.
    
    Obtain the Shrink/Grow button by using the document.getElementById method, and assign it to the changeSize variable.
